_My broad research program is on the cognitive underpinnings of law: the study of rules that emerge due to human nature (our cognition), and how that informs and improves manmade rules (law) which moderate interactions between two persons or distinct groups._

I largely focus on using natural language processing techniques, machine learning, and neuroscientific tecniques to develop understandings of how people process creative works and the legal concepts to protect them.
